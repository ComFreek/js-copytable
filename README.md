js-copytable
============

Copies the contents of a table into the clipboard for pasting in Microsoft Excel.


Browser support
===============

js-copytable should support all browsers.

But in order to copy the table to the clipboard (except in IE), js-copytable uses a flash solution (ZeroClipboard).
